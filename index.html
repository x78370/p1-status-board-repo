      <h1>Status Board Original</h1>
      <p>Here is a screen capture of my status board. I had three different DIY panels which each had their own HTML.</p>

      <h1>Status Board Redesign</h1>
      <p>Here is a screen capture of my redesigned status board.</p>
      <img src="img/screenshotredo.png" alt="screenshot of status board"><br><br>
      <h1>Panel repos</h1>

      <p>The emphasis on the redesign was to cut a bunch of the previous clutter out. It was culled down to the teachers and their current availability denoted by a modified status indicator color scheme, current time, and department calendar. The teacher table alternating row color was also changed to increase contrast and make it easier for eye tracking. I also fixed the column widths so they were consistent and not at the mercy of character length within them.</p>
